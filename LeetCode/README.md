## Files Included:
Here's a brief description of the problems that have been solved in this file:

- FizzBuzz.kt: A classic coding interview question where multiples of three are replaced by 'Fizz', multiples of five by 'Buzz', and multiples of both three and five by 'FizzBuzz'.

- Number_of_Steps_to_Reduce_a_Number_to_Zero.kt: This algorithm takes a number as input and reduces it to zero by subtracting 1 if it's odd or dividing by 2 if it's even. The solution tracks the number of operations needed to reach zero.

- ReverseInteger.kt: This solution takes an integer as an input, converts it into a string, reverses the string, and then converts it back to an integer. It handles negative numbers and returns 0 if an overflow occurs during the process.

- RichestCutomerWealth.kt: An algorithm that determines the richest customer by summing their total wealth from a 2D-array of wealth distribution.

- TwoSum.kt: A well-known problem that returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a target number.

- The_K_Weakest_Rows_in_a_Matrix.kt: This code is used to find the indices of the K weakest rows in a matrix. It counts the number of soldiers in each row and identifies the indices of the weakest rows.

- Middle_of_the_LinkedList.java: This code in Java determines the middle node of a singly-linked list by first counting the total number of nodes, and then traversing half the list's length to find the middle node.

- Permute.kt: This solution generates all possible permutations of a given integer array by iteratively inserting each number into every position of existing permutations.

- RemoveElement.cs: This algorithm takes an integer array and a specific value, removing all occurrences of that value in the array in-place. The function then returns the number of elements not equal to the given value, with the first "temp" elements of the array containing those non-matching values.

- Palindrome_LinkedList.cs The solution finds the middle of the linked list, reverses the first half, and then checks if both halves are identical to determine if the list is a palindrome.

-Ransom_Note.cs: Checks if a ransom note can be formed from a magazine string, returns true or false. Sorts both strings and then checks if the ransom note can be made from the magazine, returns true or false.
