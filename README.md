# LeetCode-HackerRank-Solutions
This repository features my solutions to various mini projects from LeetCode and HackerRank. All solutions are coded in Kotlin, Java, Dart, and C#. This is an excellent resource for developers who are looking to enhance their problem-solving skills or who are interested in viewing alternate solutions to these popular problems.

## Files Included:
Here's a brief description of the problems that have been solved in this repository:

- FizzBuzz.kt: A classic coding interview question where multiples of three are replaced by 'Fizz', multiples of five by 'Buzz', and multiples of both three and five by 'FizzBuzz'.

- Number_of_Steps_to_Reduce_a_Number_to_Zero.kt: This algorithm takes a number as input and reduces it to zero by subtracting 1 if it's odd or dividing by 2 if it's even. The solution tracks the number of operations needed to reach zero.

- ReverseInteger.kt: This solution takes an integer as an input, converts it into a string, reverses the string, and then converts it back to an integer. It handles negative numbers and returns 0 if an overflow occurs during the process.

- RichestCutomerWealth.kt: An algorithm that determines the richest customer by summing their total wealth from a 2D-array of wealth distribution.

- TwoSum.kt: A well-known problem that returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a target number.

Each file is a self-contained solution to the respective problem and can be run independently.
